## Description

We developed an Android application using React Native and Android Studio to reduce the time needed to find a parking space in Bras√≠lia. Initially we prototyped the application using Figma in order to get feedback about the user experience and improve the interface. We also worked with Google Firebase to manage user inputted data and easily update the cloud database. Firebase also provides tools for tracking analytics, reporting and fixing app crashes, creating marketing and product experiment. Our group collaborated using version control systems to organize modifications and assign tasks.

## Running the project

As we utilized Google Firebase, before running the project you must create a Google API key, otherwise you will not be able to acess our main functionalities. 

To run the project, you must firstly install **node** and **npm** softwares in your operational system. We used Windows for that matter. Official documentation about installation may be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Furthermore, you must install **expo-cli**, which can be done by using the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

After that, you can clone the github project and install the dependencies using the commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/gss214/park-it.git
cd park-it
npm install
```

The command **npm install** will install all dependencies of the project, which may take a while. To run the app, use the command:

```
expo start
```

You may run the app with an Android smarthphone or an emulator, as instructed by the command above.
